## Notes

(1) any kind of mushroom works, usually porcini (Steinpilz) or champignon are good ones.

Both fresh and dried ones work, but dried ones need to be soaked in water at least an hour 

(2) can be replaced by more broth

(3) Use no oil, either leave pan dry or ad very little water.

To make the water evaporate fastr, add a pinch of salt to the pan
