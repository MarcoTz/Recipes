# Gnocci

## Ingredients

* 1.2kg potatoes
* 1 egg
* 250g Ricotta or Parmesan
* 250g flour
* 2 tsp salt
* 0.5 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp nutmeg

## Steps

1. Cook, peel and mash potatoes 
2. Combine all ingredients and knead into dough (1)
3. Roll dough into about 2cm thick sausage and cut off 2cm thick slices (2)
4. Boil gnocci in water until they float to the top

## Notes

Egg and Parmesan can be left out for a vegan variant (make sure to add more flour)

(1) If the dough is too sticky, add more flour until it comes together

(2) To get the typical gnocci look, roll them over the back of a fork after forming
