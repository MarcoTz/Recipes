## Ingredients

* 500ml neutral oil
* 5 star anise
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 2 bay leaves
* 3 tbsp sichuan peppercorns
* 2 pods black cardamom
* 1 tbsp dried ginger
* 2 tsp cloves
* 3 cloves garlic
* 2 shallots
* 100g sichuan chili flakes
* 2 tsp salt

## Steps

1. Grind all spices into a powder and combine, except the chili flakes and salt
2. Heat oil with spices to about 110-120C (1)
3. Simmer for 30min to 1h
4. Strain oil and pour over the chili flakes (2)
5. Stir in salt and let cool down

(1) Once the right temperature has been reached, there should be small bubbles rising from the aromatics. If there are big bubbles the temperature is too high

(2) Oil should still be around 110-120C at this point
