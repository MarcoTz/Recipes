# Egg Fried Rice

## Ingredients

* 200g rice
* 2 eggs 
* 2 Tbsp soy sauce 
* any vegetables (1)

## Steps

1. Cook rice and leave in the fridge over night (2)
2. Wash, peel and dice vegetables (3)
3. Pan-fry the vegetables until they are done (4)
4. Add rice and fry for 2-3min
5. Add soy sauce and let evaporate (5)
6. Continue cooking for 3-5min while stirring 
7. Crack eggs into the pan and continue stirring until eggs are done

## Notes

(1) Usually spring onions are a good choice, but any combination can work.
Chilis and garlic are good for extra flavor
I often use 
* bell peppers
* carrot
* peas
* bean sprouts
* mushrooms (champignon or shiitake)

(2) If using fresh rice, use less water while cooking to avoid sticky rice

(3) For good texture, make sure all vegetable pieces have about the same size.
This means everything needs to be cut as small as the smallest ingredient

(4) Make sure to add vegetables in the correct order, so the early ones are not burnt

(5) If using a wok, pour soy sauce along the sides, so it heats up before it hits the rice

This is a good recipe for using left over vegetables
