* 1_ small onion
* 100ml [Dashi](Dashi.html)
* 1 Tbsp sake

2. Cut onion into rings / half rings
3. Combine dashi, sake, mirin, salt, onion and soy sauce in a sauce pan and cook on medium heat for about 5min
4. Stir in cooked mushrooms 
5. Lightly beat eggs in a small bowl and slowly pour into the broth and wait until eggs coagulate
6. Simmer for about 30s with a lid on, the eggs should absorb most of the broth
7. Pour omlette over the rice and optionally top with spring onions 

## Notes
 
(1) Use short or medium grain rice, if not available sushi rice is the next best option

(2) if using dried mushrooms, soak them before 
Best mushrooms are shiitake, but champignons also work

(3) For extra flavor, save some of the mushroom water and add to the dashi
