# Dashi

## Ingredients

* 1_ piece konbu (about 10cm x 10cm)
* 2 Tbsp dried bonito flakes
* 1l water

## Steps

1. Rip konbu into small pieces and add to water  
2. Heat up until just before cooking (1), and simmer for 10min (2)
3. Remove from heat, remove konbu and press out
4. Stir in bonito flakes, and let rest for 10-15min
4. Pour stock through a strainer 

## Notes

(1) The water should not be cooking, otherwise the konbu will become bitter

(2) To keep the final stock more clear, scoop out any foam that forms at the top


For a vegan version, use dried shiitake instead of bonito.
If using dried shiitake, soak them first, then rip or cut them into small pieces and simmer with the konbu
