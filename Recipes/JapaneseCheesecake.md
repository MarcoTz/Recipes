Optionally add toppings such as strawberries or other fruit, powdered sugar, matcha powder 

(1) instead of wheat flour, rice flour or mochiko also works

(2) Strawberries work the best, other berries are also good

(3) Do not overmix, otherwise the cake will not rise.
Do not undermix, otherwise the egg whites will float at the top


(4) If the dough isn't rising, the temperature is too low. 
Increase the temperature by a few degrees and continue baking until it rises
